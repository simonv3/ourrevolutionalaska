<p>
Our Revolution Alaska is an all volunteer, people-powered group working together across Alaska to endorse and win campaigns for progressive change. We invite you to join us on our state-wide member meeting call-ins every other Wednesday, at 6:30 pm to help organize for the 2018 elections.
</p>
<p>
Some regions in Alaska have local Our Revolution organizing groups which we heartily support. We are now inviting representatives of those groups as well as Alaskans at large to join us in growing a grassroots network across the state that can bring real people-power to the candidates and issues that need it here in AK.
